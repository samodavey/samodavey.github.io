Objective

To beat the dealer by having a higher card total without going over 21

Card Values

2 to 10 = Face Value

J, Q, K = 10

Ace = 1 or 11 

**Note: The card suits are irrelevant in Blackjack.**

Definitions

Blackjack = an Ace and a card worth 10 points (21 total)

Hit = draw another card

Stand = take no more cards

Bust = going over 21

How to Play

- Players place bets by putting the desired number of chips in the circle in front of their seat.

- The dealer deals two cards face up to each player. The dealer receives one card face up and one face down.

- The dealer asks each player, in turn, whether they want to hit or stand.

- Base your decision on the assumption that the dealer has a card worth 10 points in the hole.

- Indicate that you want a hit by tapping the table or making a motion to beckon another card (as if motioning someone to “come on back”). Continue until you desire no more cards.

 **Note: Most casinos do not allow you to touch the cards.**

- If you don’t want a hit (or are finished hitting), indicate so by waving your hand back and forth face down over your cards.

- Once all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals his hole card and hits or stands as appropriate.

- Payouts are issued based on the outcome.

Winning

If your total is higher than the dealer’s (or if the dealer busts), you win.

Payouts

- If you get Blackjack, the dealer pays you 3 to 2.

- If you and the dealer both get Blackjack, it is a push and no chips are given or taken away.

- If you have a higher total than the dealer (or the dealer busts), the dealer matches the amount of your chips.

- If you have a lower total than the dealer (or you bust), the dealer takes your chips.
